About ZPU licensing:

Licensing is not entirely fleshed out yet(there are many parts to a
soft CPU), but the license for the HDL will be BSD/eCos-like to be
friendly towards commercially oriented projects, however the
architecture, documentation and tools will be GPL. This means that all
updates to the architecture must be shared, but actual
implementations(which are small and can be very project speific) can
be friendly towards commercial considerations.


Patches to update files w/correct licensing info will be most appreciated!
