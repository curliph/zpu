<h2>Other directories</h2>
You probably don't need or want to download other directories.
<ul>
<li>
gccsrc - the complete GCC toolchain source. Big! Almost certainly not something you need or want to download. This has been moved to /trunk/zpugccsrc to
avoid subversion choking.
<li> roadshow - various bits and bobs to demonstrate the ZPU that has not been sorted/reorganized yet.

</ul>
